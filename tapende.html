<h1>Tapende(Olive Spread)</h1>

<p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:</p>

<blockquote><i>"Make this the night before so that the favors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. in the winter, try serving it warm."
</blockquote></i>

<h2>Ingredient</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 8oz. jar sun-dried tomatoes</li>
<li>2 large grill cloves</li>
<li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
<li>1 t. capers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
